The cultural landscapes project focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change on cultural and natural resources together. 

Richmond National Battlefield Park was established in 1936 with the purpose of preserving, protecting, interpreting and commemorating Richmond Civil War battlefield landscapes. The park has expanded in recent years, from 764 acres in 1996 to 3,362.  While the primary focus of the park is cultural and historical preservation, it also provides important resources and values for wetlands and natural communities, outdoor recreational opportunities, and partnerships with communities in the surrounding area. The park is comprised of multiple units that are embedded within a matrix of developed lands. Additional development and urban expansion threaten viewscapes, soundscapes, and park habitats (Richmond National Battlefield Park Foundation Document).
